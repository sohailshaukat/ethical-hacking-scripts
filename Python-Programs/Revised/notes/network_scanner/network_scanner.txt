Net Scanner is a tool which can be used to scan through all the devices on same network interface.

One of th method is netdiscover, usage mentioned below:
    
    netdiscover -r "range of ips in my subnet"/subnetmask

        netdiscover -r 10.0.2.1/24

    netdiscover -i "interface_name"
    
        netdiscover -i wlan0

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
    allows us to link ip addr with MAC addr
    
To communicate with another machine, machine 1 needs to know the MAC addr of machine 2.
To obtain MAC address a broadcast message is sent, it sends an ARP request to a specific MAC address also known as BroadcastMAC address.

machine 1  >> arp request >> router >>"who has the matching ip? >> all clients >> matching client will respond with ARP Response >> "I have matching ip, take my MAC addr" >> machine 1.


All clients on same network will recieve the message, querying for matching ip.

Only the client with matching ip will responf with the mac addr.

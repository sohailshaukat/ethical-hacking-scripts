### Testing Tools and Techniques

Minded Security has been doing some significant research into DOM based XSS. They are working on two projects to help with DOM Based XSS:

1\. The DOMinator Tool - A commercial tool based on the Firefox browser with modified Spidermonkey Javascript engine that helps testers identify and verify DOM based XSS flaws

See: [https://dominator.mindedsecurity.com/](https://dominator.mindedsecurity.com/) (https://github.com/wisec/DOMinator for the open source part)

2\. The DOM XSS Wiki - The start of a Knowledgebase for defining sources of attacker controlled inputs and sinks which could potentially introduce DOM Based XSS issues. Its very immature as of 11/17/2011. Please contribute to this wiki if you know of more dangerous sinks and/or safe alternatives!!

See: [http://code.google.com/p/domxsswiki/](https://code.google.com/p/domxsswiki/)

3\. DOM Snitch - An experimental Chrome extension that enables developers and testers to identify insecure practices commonly found in client-side code. From Google.

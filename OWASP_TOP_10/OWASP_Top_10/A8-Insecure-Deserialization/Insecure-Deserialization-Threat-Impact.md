[[Insecure-Deserialization]]

# Insecure Deserialization - Threat/Impact

## Threat
- Exploitation of deserialization is difficult because off-the-shelf exploits rarely work without changes or tweaks to the underlying exploit code.

## Impact
- The impact of deserialization flaws cannot be overstates, and these flaws can lead to **remote code execution attacks**, which is a serious attack.

# Cross-site Scripting
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a code injection that allows malicious code into a website.
- XSS is one of the most common website attacks, with almost every website requiring the user to have Javascript **on**.
- Rather than a direct attack on the website, XSS uses the website to attack the users of the website.
- When is XSS is placed permanently on the website, the JavaScript is executed by the browser for all visites of the page

## There are 3 Types of XSS :-
- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM XSS

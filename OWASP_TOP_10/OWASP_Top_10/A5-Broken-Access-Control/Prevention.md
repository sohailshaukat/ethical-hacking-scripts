# Preventing Broken Access Control
- Ensure you have a set of standard controls available.
- Use checklists and code-review.
- Include "public" markers to indicate the intention.
- Deny access by default application-wide.
- Use logging to detect attack attempts, and learn from them.
- Use rate-limiting.
- Invalidate access tokens after logout.

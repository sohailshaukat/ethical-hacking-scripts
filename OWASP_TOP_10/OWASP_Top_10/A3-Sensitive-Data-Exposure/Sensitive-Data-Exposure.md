# Sensitive Data Exposure

- SDE is where sensitive data from a webapplication is exposed to attackers.Most organizations today possess sensitive data, and protecting such data is vital, as attackers are constantly innovating methods to compromise and steal data.
- ![[Pasted image 20201212011009.png]]
- Such data can be of two types:
	1.  Data in transit (in motion from one location to another, across the internet or through a private network).
	2.  Data at rest (inactive, archived/stored on a USB, hard drive, and so on).
-  The risk profile for data in transit or data at rest depends on the security measures that are in place to secure data (Passwords, Credit Card numbers, Social Security Numbers, Health information, Other personal information) in either state.
- Most security weaknesses are due to the lack of encrypting sensitive information.

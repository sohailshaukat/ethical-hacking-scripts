[[Using-Components-With-Known-Vulnerabilities]]
# Preventing known vulnerabilities

- Remove components you do not require.
- Consider using less functional alternatives that you already have, rather than something slightly better that requires another component.
- You must have configuration control on all your components, and know precisely what versions you are using.
- Use scanners to find the vulnerabilities.
- Have a process to make urgent updates.

[[Using-Components-With-Known-Vulnerabilities]]

# Threat / Impact

## Threat
- While it is easy to find alreadt written workarounds for many known vulnerabilities, some vulnerabilities require concentrated effort to develop a custom workaround.

## Impact
- While most known vulnerabiliies lead to minor impacts, some of the largest breaches have relied on exploiting known vulnerabilities in components. Depending on the assets being protected, this risk should be at the top of the list.

## What is an Injection Attack?

An injection attack refers to attacks on a program by providing untrusted inputs, which are processed by an interpreter as a *Command (or) Query*, and ultimately alters the course of execution of that program. **Injection attacks are high-category dangerous vulnerabilities**, and can result in data loss, data theft, loss of data integrity, service denial, as well as, full system compromise.

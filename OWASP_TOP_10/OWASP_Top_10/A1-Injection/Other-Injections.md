[[Injection]]

**Command Injection:** This attack dynamically alters content on a webpage by entering an HTML code into an input form / text field that lacks effective input data validation.

**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Injection:** In LDAP injection, if a directory is used for website authentication, attackers can enter a harmful code into a user input field, gain unauthorized access to the directory, and modify usernames, passwords, roles and so on.

**Server-Side Include (SSI) Injection:** As SSI is a variable value, it can be modified. These variable values are modified by an attacker, which in turn allows the attacker to add, alter or delete files, and gain access to server resources.

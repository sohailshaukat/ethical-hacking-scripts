# LDAP-Injection
- Similar to SQL injection, Data store sitting behind a web application and by using web interface maybe we can be able to run back-end commands on that data store, even though we have no way of connecting to it directly.
- **ApacheDirectoryStudio** can be used to view the structure of the data store.

# Insufficient Logging and Monitoring - Threat/Impact
## Threat
Logging and monitoring are required to detect possible intrusion attempts, and to send alerts when required, so that the attacker is blocked and the system is saved from further harm.

## Impact
Logs help to keep track on how, who, when, and where attacks are happening. This helps in further investigation.

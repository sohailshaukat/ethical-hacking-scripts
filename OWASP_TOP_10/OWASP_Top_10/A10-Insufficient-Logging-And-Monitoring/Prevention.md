# Preventing Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
- Use a separate server platform to capture and store **audit/access** logs events.
- Capture logs of sync network time, system time, User ID, URL, and IP address. This helps to monitor events and patterns in real time.
- Do not record sensitive information such as passwords, access token, keys, and so on.
- Ensure strong access control on logs. Only admin's should have access to logs.
- Monitor on a regular basis.
- Create an incident response plan.

# Android Architecture
- **Linux-Kernel:** Base of Android is a Linux kernel that is highly optimizied for mobile devices made as small as possible.
	- ![[Pasted image 20201221183536.png]]
	- Has a set of drivers, each driver is designed to interface with element of a hardware.
- **Android-RunTime:** This includes set of core libraries and critically the dalvik virtual machine or DVM replaces the JVM that's used in conventional Java based applications.
	- ![[Pasted image 20201221183912.png]]
	- Dalvik again is highly optimizied for very small devices and the bytecode that it reads is different in many ways from the bytecode that's generated by conventional Java compilers.
	- So to get Dalvik Bytecode, we need to use Dalvik compatible compiler that's included with Android Developer Tools.
- **Libraries:** Associated libraries inlude libraries to manage all sorts of features of Android.

	- These libraries work at the same level of the software stack as the core runtime but they're expandable and so device makes can add their own libraries to this layer.
- **Applications Framework:** This has modules for controlling all the different components of your apps including activities which represent the screen user sees. 
	- Content providers to manage data and move that data between apps, locations, notifications, windows, resources, telephone management, etc.

- **Applications:** There are some included apps with each version of Android.

	- At minimum every version of android has had home screen, a browser, contact management, phone management and few other things..


# App Architecture 
- Apps are made up of components.
- There are four major type of components
	- *Activities* represent user interface screens.
		- Activity is represented by a Java class in programming but what the user sees is just an application screen.
	- *Widgets* manage display and user interactivity.
	- *Services* perform background jobs.
	- *Broadcast* receivers react to system messages.
		- Messages that are dispatched by operating system and by other apps.
	

# Component Architecture
- Each component in an android app is implemented as a Java class.
- You'll have both the Java classes that are included in the SDK and your own custom Java classes.
- An ***activity*** is an instance of java class `android.app.Activity`. A
- A ***button*** is an instance of java class `android.widget.Button`


# Version Of Java
- **Compiler uses Android-specific Java implementation**
	- Primarily Java 4 APIs, with a small amount of Java 6
- **Features new to Java 7 and 8 are not available**
	- try-with-resources, switch with String values, multi-catch, lambda expressions, new date/time API

# iOS Security Model
![[Pasted image 20201222143552.png]]
- Encourages developers to create and contribute new applications
- Each application undergoes a revision process
- Professional developers analyze the application code to ensure that application is safe before it is released.
- However, the application when installed gets all the permissions on a mobile device without user's consent.
While Android delegates the responsibility of ensuring security to the user, iOS ensures that the developers write safe code and tries to prevent malicious applications from being deployed in the app store.

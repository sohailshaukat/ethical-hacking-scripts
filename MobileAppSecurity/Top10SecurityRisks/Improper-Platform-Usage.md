- **Threat Agent:** Misuse of a platform feature such as Android intents, misuse of TouchID, platform permissions, the Keychain, or some other security control part of the mobile operating system.

The defining characteristic of risks in this category is that the platform provides a feature that is well defined and documented.

But the app fails to exploit that feature or misuses it.

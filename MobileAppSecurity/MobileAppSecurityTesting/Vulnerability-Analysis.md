![[Pasted image 20201222145135.png]]

Intelligence gathering and threat modeling help in fostering a thorough understanding of the app, the entry points, the data it holds, and the main potential vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability analysis may be done in three different ways as illustrated in the image above.


### Static Methods and Tools
-   **Reverse Engineering**
    -   Android: dex2jar, JD-GUI, Androguard, apkTool
    -   iOS: otool, class-dump-z
-   **Automatic and manual source code analysis**
    -   Android: Androwarn, Andrubis, ApkAnalyser, Obfuscation
    -   iOS: Flawfinder, Clang Static Analyzer


### Dynamic Methods
-   Passive network monitoring and analysis: At the device, gateway or in the VPN
-   Active network capture and manipulation: WiFi and Cellular
-   Runtime analysis
    -   Analysis of the communicating processes of internal components
-   Runtime Manipulation
    -   Invoking/manipulating specific functions
    -   Read and write variables
-   File Activity Analysis
    -   Analyze the changes in the file system during runtime


### Forensic Methods
-   Timeline Analysis
    -   Analyze the timestamp from the file system
-   Analysis of different file types
    -   SQLite databases
    -   SQLCiphers
    -   Log files
    -   Screenshots (iOS)
    -   Keychain (iOS)
    -   SharedPreferences (Android)

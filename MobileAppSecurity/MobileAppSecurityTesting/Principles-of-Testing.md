# Principles of Testing

### White-box Testing vs Black-box Testing
-   **Black-box testing**
    -   The tester has no prior knowledge about the application being tested
    -   The prime intent is to imitate a real attacker to analyze open threats and vulnerabilities.
-   **White-box testing**
    -   The tester has complete knowledge about the app under scrutiny
    -   More useful for protection against internal attackers.
-   **Gray-box testing**
    -   Tester has partial knowledge about the application the unrevealed parts are to be discovered.


### Static vs Dynamic Analysis
-   **Static analysis**
    -   Involves inspecting the components of an application, including source code without executing them.
    -   Analogous to white-box testing.
-   **Dynamic analysis**
    -   Involves inspecting the app from an outsiders perspective.
    -   It is an efficient way to analyze elements (assets, features, entry points, etc.) from a user's point of view.
    -   Analogous to black-box testing.

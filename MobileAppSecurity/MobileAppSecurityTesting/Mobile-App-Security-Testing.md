# Mobile App Security Testing
Usually, mobile app security tests are part of a larger security assessment process that hedges in the server-side APIs and the client-server architecture used by the mobile app.

Mobile app security testing may be performed in two contexts

-   The first is the **classical security test** that is performed at the near end of the development lifecycle.
-   The other context is characterized by the automation of security tests right from **the beginning of the software development lifecycle.**


##### Testing Process: The Essence
-   The process, while considering the characteristics of mobile devices is independent of technologies.
-   Helps in improving the transparency of the testing process.
-   Facilitates the repeated application of the process and hence improves efficiency.
-   Is a flexible and holistic approach.
-   Ultimately helps in enhancing mobile app security.

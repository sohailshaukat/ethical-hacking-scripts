# Attack Goals
While the intention behind an attack may depend on the attacker, attack goals may be broadly classified under the following three categories:
- To collect private data
- Utilizing computing resources
- Harmful malicious actions

The goals may further be described as **covert or harmful.**

- **Covert approach** to attacks aims at performing malicious operations without being noticed.

- **Harmful attacks** aim at disrupting the normal operation of the mobile device.

While collecting private data and utilizing computing resources may be covert, the latter is harmful.

# DroidDream
In the year 2011, a malware hit the official Android Market with this lethal trojan.

Packaged inside more than 50 seemingly legitimate applications, DroidDream deceived more than **250,000** users into downloading it before Google removed it from its marketplace.

DroidDream **provided attackers root access** to potentially seize the entire device and its data, sending private user information to the attacker and laid the groundwork for a mobile botnet.

An **Attack Vector**, by definition, is a method or technique used by an attacker to gain access to another computing device or network.

Mobile platforms present multiple attack vectors that may be exploited with malicious intent.

*Above is the schematic representation of the attack process that may contain several attack vectors at a time.*

Some of the common mobile attack vectors are:
- **Malware**
	- Virus and Rootkit
	- Application modification
	- OS modification
- **Data Exfiltration**
	- Data leaves the organization
	- Print screen
	- Copy to USB and backup loss
- **Data Tampering**
	- Modification by another application
	- Undetected tampering attempts
	- Jail-broken devices
- **Data Loss**
	- Device loss
	- Unauthorized device access
	- Application vulnerabilities
- **Resource Sharing**
	- Data Leakage
	- Insecure Communication
	- Insufficient cryptography

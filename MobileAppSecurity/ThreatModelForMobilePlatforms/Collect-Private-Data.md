# Collect Private Data

Since mobile devices have become a convenient storage unit for personal data, they have also become an **attractive target for privacy infringement.**

In recent years, the embedding of sensors in mobile devices has enabled applications to track almost every aspect of the user's lifestyle and preferences.

A successfully executed attack can help the attacker gain access to SMS and e-mail messages, contact details, call logs as well as data stored in the device's memory or on SD cards such as photos, videos, and documents.

Besides, by tapping into the device's hardware, the attacker may be able to collect more data about the user's surroundings.

**Confidentiality** and **integrity** of personal data are at stake during a privacy breach.

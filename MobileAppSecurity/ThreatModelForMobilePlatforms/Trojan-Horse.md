Malicious mobile applications could help an attacker gain control of the device.

Such applications are usually framed in such a way that they perform some useful functionality in the front while performing some malicious task in the background.

Trojans usually exploit such tactics to **steal sensitive information** from a device or to make way for some other malicious application like **botnets** or **worms.**

Additionally, Trojans have also been known to be involved in **phishing activities.**
- For example, a fake banking application can be exploited to cause havoc among users.
Such malicious applications usually proliferate through **unsupervised application stores** or via **social networks.**

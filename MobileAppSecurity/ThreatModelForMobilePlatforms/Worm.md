A Worm is a **self-replicating malicious application** designed to spread independently to uninfected systems.

This type of malware has been noticed in mobile platforms since the introduction of Cabir, which primarily targeted mobile phones running **Symbian OS.**

Another example of a worm type malware for mobile devices is __*Ikee.B*__ which was used to steal financially sensitive data from jailbroken iPhones.

# Rootkit
A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to **enable access** to a computer or areas of its software **that is not otherwise allowed** (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often **masks its existence** or the existence of other software.

Once infected, a rootkit can be used as a gateway to facilitate future attacks.

For example, rootkits are commonly used to conceal keyloggers, which steal sensitive user data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, by silently logging keystrokes.

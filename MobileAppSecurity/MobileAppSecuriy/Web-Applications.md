# Web Applications
Mobile web applications are websites that are designed to resemble the look and feel of native applications.

These apps are **rendered using a device's browser** and are usually developed in HTML5.

A prime advantage of web applications is that the cost of development and maintenance is less as web applications are associated with a **single code base.**

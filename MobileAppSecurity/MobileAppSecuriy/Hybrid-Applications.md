# Hybrid Applications
Hybrid applications attempt to bridge the gap between native and web applications.

A hybrid application executes like a native application, but a majority of the processes depend on web technologies.

- A portion of the app operates in an embedded web browser (also known as "web view").
As such, hybrid apps inherit both the pros and cons of native and web apps.

To facilitate access to device capabilities that are not accessible to pure web applications, a **web-to-native abstraction layer** is used.

Based on the framework used for development, one code base can yield multiple applications that target different platforms, with a UI closely resembling that of the initial platform for which the app was developed.

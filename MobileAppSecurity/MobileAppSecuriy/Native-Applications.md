# Native Applications
Mobile operating systems, come with a **Software Development Kit (SDK)** for developing **applications specific to the OS.** Such applications are considered native to the system for which they have been developed.

**Advantages of Native Apps**
- Possesses the potential to provide the **fastest performance** with the **highest degree of reliability.**
- Renders a **consistent user interface(UI)** as the development process adheres to platform-specific design principles.
- Apps have direct access to almost every component of the device (camera, sensors) as they are closely integrated with the operating system.
However, the major disadvantage of native apps is that they are **specifically tailored for one specific platform.**

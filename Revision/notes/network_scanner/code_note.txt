Easiest way to send an ARP ping is by using 'arping(ip)' method.

code snippet:

'''
from scapy.all import *

def scan(ip):
    arping(ip)

scan("192.168.0.107")

#or
#scan("192.168.0.1/16")
'''

scapy.ARP() is a method that is used to create arp_request.

to get the list of arguments following 'ls' command could be used.

    scapy.ls(scapy.ARP())

sc.Ether() will create a broadcast ether frame which can be appended to arp_request. 

.summary() will return a short summarised sting to print giving a brief information about packet.

.show() will print detailed information about the packet. 

sc.srp() is a method that takes in request as argument, sends to the dest in ether frame, recives the responseand returns it

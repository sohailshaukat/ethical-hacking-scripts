scapy.ARP() takes in op as one of the arguments.

op = 1 -> for ARP request. -> 'who has'
op = 2 -> for ARP response. -> 'is at'

putting ',' after print statement saves the print statement to buffer instead of printing it out. Once the program is exited the buffer will be cleared.

sys.stdout.flush() will flush this buffer and instead of putting the print statement in bufferm it will flush the buffer and spill out the print statement.

'\r' tells python to print only from start of the line.

for python3 we wont need to add ',' and sys.stdout.flush() instead we can provide an argument 'end=""'.

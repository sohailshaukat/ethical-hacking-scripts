to start webserver on kali command is

    service apache2 start

DNS -> Domain Name Server

After enabling the webserver you can openthe webpage hosted by the webserver by entering the ip in browser on same network

Each of such instances are mapped according to their ips

When an URL is entered, DNS does the 1-1 mapping of IP and URL. So computer will send the request to DNServer this just designed to resolve domain names to ipaddress.

Then DNServer will send a response to the user and will return the ip of domain and now computer can access the website.

Basically by altering the DNS response we can redirect user to website hosted by our webserver.

# Access Management

Access Management is managing the access control to various resources in an organization to determine who can access what resources under what conditions.

Every business has information that needs to be protected from unauthorized disclosure.

To protect information, companies define policies that govern who can access specific classes of business and/or personal information.

Access Management is a solution that provides a mechanism to manage the authentication of users (including single sign-on) and implement business rules determining user access to applications and data.


Access Management system takes care of following items:
1.  Authentication - verifying users are who they claim to be
2.  Authorization - granting users access to resources (also called entitlements)
3.  Auditing - recording who did what and when
4.  Administration - managing users and entitlements
5.  Confidentiality - protecting data from unauthorized eyes
6.  Notification - actively communicating security events

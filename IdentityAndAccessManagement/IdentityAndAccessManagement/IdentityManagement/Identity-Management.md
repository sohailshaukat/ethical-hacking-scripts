# Identity Management
Identity Management is managing the user identities in the multiple directories and identity stores across an organization.

Identity Manager provides an integrated method of managing users and their access to various applications. It can be used to enforce segregation of duties.

It prevents users from receiving privileges that may result in a conflict.

The administrator can check for any violations before assigning privileges/changing profile attributes.

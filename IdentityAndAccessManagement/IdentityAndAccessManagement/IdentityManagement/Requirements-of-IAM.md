# Requirements of IAM

Modern organizations run a complex mix of IT infrastructure, including: Network OS, Application Servers, Webservers, Database servers, Emails and messaging services, User directories, Sharepoint sites, CRM, Payroll management and ERP applications

Almost every system and application track its own users, how they sign in (i.e., their passwords) and their privileges (i.e., what they can see and do).

This data about users must be managed, when users are hired, when their business roles or identifying information change and when they leave.

The diversity of these systems, each with their own user interface, administrators and change request processes creates complexity.

Identity management technologies simplify the administration of this distributed, overlapping and sometimes contradictory data about users.

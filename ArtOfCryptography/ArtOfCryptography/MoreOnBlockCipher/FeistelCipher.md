Also known as Feistel Network, Feistel cipher is NOT a type or mode of block ciphers.

Feistel cipher is a symmetric cryptographic model used for designing and constructing block ciphers.

One major advantage of Feistel cipher is that the encryption and decryption process is almost the same, requiring only a few manipulations in the key schedule.

Feistel networks are iterative adding to the ease of implementation in hardware systems.

Feistel implementations constitute multiple iterations of repeated operations such as:

    Bit-shuffling
    Simple non-linear functions
    Linear mixing using XOR

DES was one of the most popular block cipher used in the 1990s.

    Encrypts 64-bit data with 56-bit keys
    From the 56-bit key, 16 subkeys are generated
    The process is repeated through 16 rounds of processing

The security depends on the algorithm used and the length of the key.

Security of DES

    In 1998, a DES-encrypted message was cracked in three days.

    In 1999, a network of 10,000 desktop computers managed to crack a DES-encrypted message in just 1 day.

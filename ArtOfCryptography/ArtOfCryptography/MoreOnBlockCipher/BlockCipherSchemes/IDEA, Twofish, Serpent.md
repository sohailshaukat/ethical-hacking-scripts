IDEA

    International Data Encryption Algorithm

    Block size - 64 bits and Key size - 128 bits

    Due to patent issues the use of IDEA has restricted adoption
	
Twofish

    Block size - 128 bits and Key sizes up to 256 bits

    Distinctive features: Use of precomputed key-dependent S-boxes, A relatively complex key schedule
    
Serpent

    Block size - 128 bits and Key size - 128, 192, or 256 bits

    It is comparatively slower but has a more secure design than other block ciphers

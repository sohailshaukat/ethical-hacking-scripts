Digital signatures are another way to ensure message authenticity and are based on the concepts of public key cryptography.

Digital signatures are used to bind a person or an entity to a digital message and can be verified by the end user or any third party.

    Digital signatures are analogous to handwritten signatures in many aspects but properly implemented digital signatures are much harder to forge than handwritten signatures.

Digital signatures can also be used to enforce non-repudiation in the sense that the signer cannot deny signing a message while claiming the secrecy of their private key.

Hash functions are generally used in cryptosystems to convert the data into a unique and non-reversible code.

Uniqueness is achieved when two different sets of data generate different hash values even if they differ only by a bit.

Non-reversible implies that the hash code generated cannot be manipulated to retrieve the original data.

Hash functions are designed in such a way that the smallest change in the original data causes a significant change in the hash generated.

Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) are the most popular hash functions.

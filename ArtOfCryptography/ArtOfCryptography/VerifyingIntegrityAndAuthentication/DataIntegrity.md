Data Integrity

Symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes are used to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data, that is, to ensure that the data is accessible only to the intended recipients.

However, when data is exchanged between two or more entities another important aspect to consider is data integrity, that is, to ensure that the data has not been tampered with during the communication process.

Two types of data integrity threats have been identified in the field of digital security.

    Passive Threats: Noise in the communication channel and data corruption during file storage
    Active Threats: An attacker manipulating data with malicious intent

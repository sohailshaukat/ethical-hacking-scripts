Lack of message authentication is another threat for data in the communication model in which the originator of the message remains uncertain.

Message authentication is ensured with the help of cryptographic techniques that use secret keys.

Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a commonly used cryptographic technique used to enforce message authentication.

MAC is an encrypted checksum coined from the underlying message and attached to the message sent to enable the end user to verify the authenticity of the message.

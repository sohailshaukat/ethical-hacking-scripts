A transposition cipher is an encryption strategy in which the position of the individual tokens of the plaintext are shifted in accordance with a regular system.

    The ciphertext is a permutation of the plaintext.

In simple words, the order of the individual units is changed, i.e., the plaintext is rearranged.

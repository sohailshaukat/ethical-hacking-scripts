Symmetric cryptography is a cryptographic method that uses a single key for both decryption and encryption.

The sender utilizes the key to encrypt the plaintext and tramsmits the ciphertext to the receiver.
The receiver utilizes the same key to decrypt the message to recover the plaintext.

    Because a single key is used for both functions, symmetric cryptography is also called Secret Key Cryptography.

The "secret" in symmetric key cryptography is the key which must be known to both the sender and the receiver.

Classical Symmetric Cryptography

Broadly classified into two categories: Substitution Ciphers and Transposition Ciphers.

    In substitution ciphers, individual characters are replaced by some other characters.
    In transposition ciphers, the order of the characters is rearranged.

Classical Symmetric Ciphers may be:

    Monoalphabetic - a single substitution/transposition is applied.
    Polyalphabetic - multiple substitutions/ transpositions are applied.

A product cipher may be formed by concatenating several such ciphers.

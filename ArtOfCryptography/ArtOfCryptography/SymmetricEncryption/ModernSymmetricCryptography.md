Digital data is represented as strings of binary digits (bits) and not using alpha-numeric characters or special symbols.

Modern cryptosystems should be capable of processing these binary strings in order to convert them into a format that is unintelligible to intruders.

Based on how these binary strings are manipulated, symmetric encryption schemes can be classified as:

    Stream Ciphers: Data is treated as individual bits
    Block Ciphers: Data is treated in blocks

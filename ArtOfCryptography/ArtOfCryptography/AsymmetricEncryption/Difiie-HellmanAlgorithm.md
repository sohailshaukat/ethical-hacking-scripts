The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is a key exchange algorithm.

Initially, the secure communication of encrypted data between two entities demanded the secure exchange of the keys using a secure physical channel.

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange facilitates two entities that have no prior knowledge of each other to exchange secret keys over insecure channels.

The keys exchanged can then be used to encrypt messages using an encryption algorithm.

Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key cryptographic strategy that exploits the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields.

One of the significant advantages of ECC is that the size of the keys used can be much smaller than the keys used in other algorithms.

Elliptic curves find application in various areas of digital security such as

    Key agreement
    Digital Signatures
    Pseudo-random generators
    Integer factorization algorithms

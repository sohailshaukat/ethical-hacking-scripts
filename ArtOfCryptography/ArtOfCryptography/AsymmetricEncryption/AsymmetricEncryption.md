Asymmetric cryptography, also known as Public Key Cryptography, makes use of two keys: a public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt data.

The public key is the key that is shared with everyone. The private key is kept a secret.

Either of the keys can be used for encryption, and the other is used for decryption.

Asymmetric Algorithms

Some of the prominent asymmetric algorithms are:

    Diffie-Hellman
    RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
    ECC (Elliptic-Curve Cryptography)

Let's look in detail each one of these algorithms.

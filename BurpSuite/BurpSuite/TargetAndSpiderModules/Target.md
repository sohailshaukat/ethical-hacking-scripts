Target is mainly used to do footprinting manually. You have two sub-tabs under - "**Site Map**" and "**Scope**".

-** Site Map **- It helps to capture all the host URL of the targeted website.

-** Scope **- It helps to focus the particular host URL, which we like to target.

		A website will have many URLs for example Facebook and YouTube links. However, your scope is not to test the Facebook and "YouTube" sites, which is present on the website you targeted. So you can right-click the targeted host URL, and find the option Add to scope, to focus the particular URL alone.

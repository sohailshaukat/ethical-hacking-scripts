**Repeater** helps to get the multiple requests modified and unmodified.

You can right-click on any request in **"Intercept"** or **"HTTP History"** and find an option called **"Send to Repeater"**. Once you click it, navigate to **Repeater** tab.

You can find the request which you sent. Moreover, by clicking the **"Go Button"**, you can see the response in the response tab.

Also, you can click the **Render** tab, which helps to render the same image of our webpage.

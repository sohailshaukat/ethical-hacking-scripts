## **Sequencer**
- **Sequencer** helps to check the strength of the variables like *`(Session ID and Tokens ID)`*, which is sent to the server in random values. If the hacker can predict the variable(s), they can steal the user session and user data.

- **To prevent this, your application needs to undergo the process of sequencer scanning to check that the variable is random and determine how hard it is to be predicted.**

When you click a 'call' appearing on **HTTP History tab**, you get a detailed view below with two tabs, namely **"Request"** and **"Response"**.

- Request 

		This tab shows what request was made from the client end.

		Note: You cannot change the request body here because HTTP History Tab only helps to capture and not to modify.

- Response
	
		This tab shows what request was made from the server end.

# Theat Modeling
![[19432_Significance.jpeg]]

> _**Threat modeling**_ _can be defined as a family of activities for **enhancing security** by **identifying objectives and vulnerabilities**, and then **defining countermeasures** to prevent, or mitigate the effects of the threats to the system._

In simple words, threat modeling is a planned activity for recognizing and evaluating application threats and vulnerabilities.

Threat modeling can be applied to a wide range of applications, including software, systems, networks, distributed systems, components of the internet of things, and business processes.

##### Need of Threat Modeling

-   Identifying security flaws at the earliest helps reduce overheads.
-   Helps save time, resources and the reputation of the organization.
-   Helps build reliable applications.
-   To bridge the gap between development and security.
-   Aids in efficient documentation of identified threats, security flaws, and solutions.
-   Helps develop an awareness of the latest risks and vulnerabilities.

##### What is in a Threat Model?

**Usually, a threat model incorporates the following details:**

-   A description/design/model of issues to be concerned about.
-   A list of assumptions that can be examined or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes.
-   A list of potential threats to the system
-   A list of actions to be taken for each threat
-   Strategies to validate the model and threats
-   Analysis of actions taken


##### The Four Questions

The essence of threat modeling can be expressed using the following four questions.

-   **What are you working on?**
    -   Identify the assets and the attack vectors (entry/exit points).
-   **What can go wrong?**
    -   Identify threats: Anything that can compromise an asset is a threat.
-   **What are you going to do about it?**
    -   Mitigate the threats and reduce risk.
-   **Did we do a good job?**
    -   Analyze the previous steps.

To determine if an application is satisfactorily secure or not, combinations of these ingredients need to be analyzed.

##### Threat Modeling Methodologies

Conceptually a threat modeling practice flows from a methodology. Numerous threat modeling methodologies are available for implementation.

The five most well-known methodologies are:

-   **STRIDE**
-   **PASTA**
-   **Trike**
-   **VAST**
-   **OCTAVE**

##### STRIDE Methodology

STRIDE is a model of security threats developed by _Praerit Garg_ and _Loren Kohnfelder_ at Microsoft.

It is a model of threats, used to help analyze and find threats to a system.

It provides a mnemonic for security threats under six categories.

> Each threat is a violation of security property.

_The table above illustrates the attributes of STRIDE, the security property violated by each threat, and what can be done to overcome the threat (Mitigation approach)._

##### PASTA

**P**rocess for **A**ttack **S**imulation and **T**hreat **A**nalysis

-   Seven-step, risk-centric methodology.
-   Aims at aligning business objectives and technical requirements.
-   The intent of the method is to provide a **dynamic threat identification**, **enumeration**, and **scoring** process.
-   Intends to provide an attacker-centric view of the application and infrastructure from which defenders can develop an asset-centric mitigation strategy.

> The prime aim of PASTA is to address the most viable threats to a given application target.

##### Trike

Trike threat modeling is an open source threat modeling methodology focused on satisfying the **security auditing process** from a cyber risk management perspective.

A **"requirements model"** is the foundation of the methodology. The requirements model guarantees that the assigned level of risk for each asset is acceptable to the stakeholders.

The Trike threat modeling methodology uses DFDs to illustrate the flow of data and the functions of end users.

-   A trike threat model is generated by analyzing the implementation model.
    
-   Using the threat model, appropriate risk values are assigned to each threat identified and then attack graphs are generated.
    
-   Mitigating controls are assigned to address the threats and the risks associated.
    
-   Finally, a risk model is developed from the completed threat model based on assets, roles, actions, and threat exposure.

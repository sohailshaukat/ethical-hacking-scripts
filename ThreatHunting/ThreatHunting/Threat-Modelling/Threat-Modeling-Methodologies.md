##### Threat Modeling Methodologies

Conceptually a threat modeling practice flows from a methodology. Numerous threat modeling methodologies are available for implementation.

The five most well-known methodologies are:

-   **STRIDE**
-   **PASTA**
-   **Trike**
-   **VAST**
-   **OCTAVE**

##### STRIDE Methodology

STRIDE is a model of security threats developed by _Praerit Garg_ and _Loren Kohnfelder_ at Microsoft.

It is a model of threats, used to help analyze and find threats to a system.

It provides a mnemonic for security threats under six categories.

> Each threat is a violation of security property.

_The table above illustrates the attributes of STRIDE, the security property violated by each threat, and what can be done to overcome the threat (Mitigation approach)._

##### PASTA

**P**rocess for **A**ttack **S**imulation and **T**hreat **A**nalysis

-   Seven-step, risk-centric methodology.
-   Aims at aligning business objectives and technical requirements.
-   The intent of the method is to provide a **dynamic threat identification**, **enumeration**, and **scoring** process.
-   Intends to provide an attacker-centric view of the application and infrastructure from which defenders can develop an asset-centric mitigation strategy.

> The prime aim of PASTA is to address the most viable threats to a given application target.

##### Trike

Trike threat modeling is an open source threat modeling methodology focused on satisfying the **security auditing process** from a cyber risk management perspective.

A **"requirements model"** is the foundation of the methodology. The requirements model guarantees that the assigned level of risk for each asset is acceptable to the stakeholders.

The Trike threat modeling methodology uses DFDs to illustrate the flow of data and the functions of end users.

-   A trike threat model is generated by analyzing the implementation model.
    
-   Using the threat model, appropriate risk values are assigned to each threat identified and then attack graphs are generated.
    
-   Mitigating controls are assigned to address the threats and the risks associated.
    
-   Finally, a risk model is developed from the completed threat model based on assets, roles, actions, and threat exposure.

##### VAST

**VAST**: **V**isual, **A**gile, and **S**imple **T**hreat modeling.

The underlying principle of this methodology emphasizes the necessity of scaling the threat modeling process across the infrastructure and entire Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) and integrating it consistently into an Agile software development methodology.

A distinguishing feature of the VAST threat modeling methodology is its practical approach.

The security concerns faced by the development team might be different from those of the infrastructure team. To efficiently handle the difference, VAST calls for two types of threat models:

-   **Application Threat Models**
-   **Operational Threat Models**

##### VAST: Threat Models

-   **Application Threat Models** are intended for development teams and are solely intended for the application under consideration. The primary purpose is to:
    
    -   Identify the threats that the application may be vulnerable to.
    -   To enlighten the developers on mitigation strategies to address the threats starting with the creation of Process Flow Diagrams.
-   **Operational Threat Models** allow organizations to visualize the infrastructure risk profile
    
    -   Enhances the understanding of the full attack surface for key stakeholders.
    -   Helps organizational leaders equip themselves plan and prioritize infrastructure risk mitigation strategies.

##### OCTAVE

**OCTAVE:** **O**perationally **C**ritical **T**hreat, **A**sset, and **V**ulnerability **E**valuation methodology

OCTAVE threat modeling methodology focuses on assessing (non-technical) organizational risks that may lead from breached data assets.

Utilizing this threat modeling methodology, information assets of an organization are recognized and the datasets they include get attributes based on the type of data stored.

OCTAVE threat modeling offers organizational risk awareness, and a robust, asset-centric view, the documentation can turn huge.

This method is most helpful when developing a risk-aware corporate culture. It is customizable to the risk environment and specific security objectives of an organization.

##### Choosing the Right Methodology

From a theoretical perspective, each methodology offers security teams and organizations the means to recognize potential threats and may seem indistinguishable.

However, on a practical level, threat modeling methodologies vary in quality, consistency, and value received for the resources invested

##### Maltego

-   Built on **`Kali Linux`**, it displays the information precisely and quickly through **graphical interface**.
    
-   Hidden connections on a network can be detected using Maltego.
    
-   Allows **many customizable options**, hence Maltego is considered a **powerful and dynamic Threat Hunting platform**.

##### Sqrrl

> **`Sqrrl`** is designed for **enterprise Threat Hunting**.

-   Provides maximum network protection by combining
    
    -   **Incident investigations**
        
    -   **Proactive Threat Hunting**
        
    -   **Automated analytics**
        
-   Provides unique features like
    
    -   **Hunting Loop**
        
    -   **Hunting Maturity Model**
        
    -   **Comprehensive search language**
        
    -   **Asset tagging**
        
    -   **Investigation recording**

##### Vectra

-   Vectra automates threat detection, empowers threat hunters and exposes hidden attackers.
    
-   Applies **`Artificial Intelligence(AI)`** to detect and hunt for cyber attacks in real time.
    

Highest damage causing threats are

-   **Triaged**
    
-   **Correlated to hosts** and
    
-   **Prioritized**
    

to quickly stop further progress attacks and avert data loss.

##### Infocyte Hunt

Infocyte proactively hunts for **malware and persistent threats** without complicated equipment or endpoint software installations.

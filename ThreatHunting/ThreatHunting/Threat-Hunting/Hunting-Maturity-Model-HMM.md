##### Hunting Maturity Model (HMM)

Developed by David Bianco, Sqrrl’s security technologist. **Hunting Maturity Model (HMM) determines the Hunting ability of an organization**.

-   The quality and amount of the information that an association routinely gathers from its IT environment is a solid factor in deciding their level of Hunting Maturity.
    
-   HMM describes the five levels of Hunting capability, ranging from **HM0 to HM4**.
    
    -   HM0 being the least capable
        
    -   HM4 is the most capable.

##### Levels of Hunting Maturity Model

The following are the five levels of Hunting maturity model.

-   **HM0 – Initial**
    
-   **HM1 – Minimal**
    
-   **HM2 – Procedural**
    
-   **HM3 — Innovative**
    
-   **HM4 — Leading**

##### HM0 - Initial

> Organizations at this level are not capable of hunting.

**Characteristics**

-   Very limited or no information is gathered.
    
-   A proactive investigation doesn't take place.
    

Organizations at this level depend mostly on automated alerting tools like IDS, SIEM antivirus, etc.

##### HM1 - Minimal

> Organizations at this level are experimenting with Threat Hunting.

**Characteristics**

-   Moderate or a large amount of data is collected from some key factors.
    
-   When new dangers become obvious, investigators can remove the key pointers from these reports and search recorded information to see whether they have been seen in any event in the ongoing past.
    
-   Review threat intelligence to develop a new hypothesis.
    
-   Uses SIEM and log analysis tools.
    

##### HM2 - Procedural

> Organizations at this level are capable for part-time Threat Hunting.

**Characteristics**

-   Collects a large amount of data throughout the enterprise.
    
-   Review threat intelligence and friendly intelligence to develop a new hypothesis.
    

At this level organizations,

-   Learn and apply methodology created by others on a fairly normal premise
    
-   May roll out minor improvements but are not equipped for making completely new procedures by themselves.
    

##### HM3 - Innovative

> Organizations develop new hunting methods.

**Characteristics**

-   Collects a large amount of data throughout the IT environment.
    
-   Review threat intelligence, friendly intelligence and manual cyber risk scoring to develop a new hypothesis.

##### HM4 - Leading

> -   The only difference between HM3 and HM4 level is **Automation**.

**Characteristics**

-   Huge collection of various types of information throughout the IT environment.
    
-   Review threat intelligence, friendly intelligence and automate cyber risk scoring to develop a new hypothesis.
    

The most successful hunts are automated to reduce the burden of performing the frequently occurring process repeatedly.

##### Skills Required

Threat Hunting is basically a **`human-based activity`**. Hence **skilled experts** are very important to perform effective Threat Hunting.

---

The **`four critical skills`** to be possessed by Threat Hunter include.

**1\. Pattern recognition**

**2\. Data Analytics**

**3\. Malware analysis**

**4\. Communication**



##### Pattern Recognition

Threat Hunters have to look for **`patterns`** that

-   Match the **tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP)** of familiar threat actors, advanced malware, and abnormal behaviors.
    
-   Need to understand the **normal behavior and patterns in their network**, in order to detect the above patterns.
    
-   Construct and develop **logical theories** to access a network, in order to gain access to specific analytical information.
    
-   After having **hypothesis built**, Threat Hunters should work backward, using deductive reasoning, to search for any clues and signs that would be left beyond by attackers within scenarios.


##### Data Analytics

To perform **`Data analytics`**, Threat Hunters depend on the technology to

-   Monitor the environment and
    
-   Gather information.
    

**Knowledge Required:**

Threat Hunters must have a clear understanding of data science approaches, tools, and techniques.

##### Malware Analysis

Whenever new threats are detected by Threat Hunters, they regularly need to **examine and figure out newly discovered malware through Indicator of compromise (IOC)**.

They need to **perform data forensics activities** to understand:

-   How the malware was initially deployed
    
-   What are the malware capabilities and
    
-   Degree of harm that malware might have caused.


##### Communication

Once the threats or vulnerabilities within the network are detected, Threat Hunters should promptly convey the information to the **appropriate stakeholders and staff individuals** so that the issue can be effectively addressed and reduced.

> If the attacks are not properly addressed to the right stakeholders, attackers will continue to have the upper hand.

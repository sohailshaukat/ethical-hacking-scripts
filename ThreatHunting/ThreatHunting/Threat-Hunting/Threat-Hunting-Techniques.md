##### Threat Hunting Techniques

The **four** common Threat Hunting techniques include:

-   **Searching**
    
-   **Clustering**
    
-   **Grouping**
    
-   **Stack counting**
    

These techniques are used to identify the threats.

##### Searching

Two essential points to be considered while doing a **SEARCH** include:

-   Hunting **too broadly** for general artifacts may deliver awfully **numerous outcomes** of very little use.
    
-   Focusing **too specifically** may create excessively **few outcomes**, making it impossible to conclude.
    

> Among other techniques - _SEARCH_ is considered to be the **`least difficult technique`** for Hunting.


##### Clustering

-   Clustering is a **`measurable method`** that focuses on isolating groups of similar information.
    
-   Normally, done by utilizing **Machine learning**.
    

**Usage:**

Applicable, when managing a broad set of information that doesnâ€™t explicitly share behavioral statistics.

##### Grouping

-   **`Grouping`** is based on alignment with specific criteria. In grouping, various kinds of unique articrafts are clubbed together.
    
-   The key distinction between **Grouping** and **Clustering** is that grouping happens based on specific criteria, while clustering is based on available information.
    

**Usage**: This technique works best when you are hunting for many related occurrences of unique articrafts.

##### Stack Counting

-   Stacking includes **`counting`** the number of events for values of a specific type, and **`examining`** the exceptions to those outcomes.
    
-   The applicability of this technique is decreased when managing large and different information collections.
    

**Usage:** Stacking is best utilized with data sets that create a limited number of results.

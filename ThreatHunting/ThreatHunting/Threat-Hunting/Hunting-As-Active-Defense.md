[[Threat-Hunting]]

##### Hunting as Active Defense

-   Industry standard security operations teams using passive monitoring and detection are no longer sufficient to protect important assets. The best way to deal with this is Active Defense.
    
-   **`Active Defense`** is not what technologies an organization uses, but rather the **capabilities** and the **weapons** that are used to reduce the attacks.
    
-   Active Defense is the combination of **Threat Intelligence** and **security best practices**.
    
-   The Cyber Kill Chain and Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis are used to identify intrusions and understand attackers campaigns. These two models are fed into the Active Cyberdefense.

##### Cyber Kill Chain

The various stages of cyber attacks are described by **Cyber Kill Chain**. It is an adaptation of the **U.S military’s kill chain process**.

Seven stages are involved in Cyber Kill Chain.

##### Cyber Kill Chain Stages

-   **Reconnaissance**: Targets are researched, identified and selected.
    
-   **Weaponization**: Exploits with backdoor are coupled into the deliverable payload.
    
-   **Delivery**: Weapons are transmitted to the target
    
-   **Exploitation**: Once delivered, the weapon’s code is triggered, exploiting vulnerable applications or system.

-   **Installation**: Here, the weapon installs a backdoor on a victim’s system allowing persistent access.
    
-   **Command and control**: Outside server communicated with the weapons providing “hand on keyboard access” inside the target’s network.
    
-   **Actions on objective**: The attacker works to achieve the goals of the intrusion, which can add destruction or exfiltration of data or intrusion of another target.


##### The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

The Diamond Models work on the relationship between the features, instead of looking at a series of events. This model enables you to understand the nature of the threat better; you are dealing with.

-   The Diamond Model for intrusion analysis accounts for an adversary and draws a **`relationship`** with the victim.
    
-   It allows you to develop **intelligence** picture over time.
    
-   An adversary can represent many different perspectives of different times along the intelligence life cycle.
    


##### The Active Cyber Defense Cycle

The **Active Cyber Defense Cycle** uses the Threat Intelligence generated from the previous two models and put it into the context of active defense.

**`Four phases`** are involved in The Active Cyber Defense Cycle.

-   Threat Intelligence consumption
    
-   Asset Identification and network security monitoring
    
-   Incident Response
    
-   Threat and environmental Manipulation
